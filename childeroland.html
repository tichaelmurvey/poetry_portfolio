                <h1>Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came</h1>
                <h2>Robert Browning</h2>
               <p class="num">I</p>
<p class="stanza">My first thought was, he lied in every word,  <br>
That hoary cripple, with malicious eye <br>
Askance to watch the workings of his lie <br>
On mine, and mouth scarce able to afford <br>
Suppression of the glee, that pursed and scored <br>
Its edge, at one more victim gained thereby.</p>

<p class=num>II</p>

<p class="stanza">
What else should he be set for, with his staff? <br>
What, save to waylay with his lies, ensnare <br>
All travellers who might find him posted there, <br>
And ask the road? I guessed what skull-like laugh<br>
Would break, what crutch ’gin write my epitaph <br>
For pastime in the dusty thoroughfare.</p>

<p class="num">III</p>

<p class="stanza">If at his counsel I should turn aside <br>
Into that ominous tract which, all agree, <br>
Hides the Dark Tower. Yet acquiescingly <br>
I did turn as he pointed, neither pride <br>
Now hope rekindling at the end descried, <br>
So much as gladness that some end might be.</p>

<p class="num">IV</p>
<p class="stanza">For, what with my whole world-wide wandering, <br>
What with my search drawn out through years, my hope <br>
Dwindled into a ghost not fit to cope <br>
With that obstreperous joy success would bring, <br>
I hardly tried now to rebuke the spring <br>
My heart made, finding failure in its scope.</p>

<p class="num">V</p>
<p class="stanza">
As when a sick man very near to death <br>
Seems dead indeed, and feels begin and end <br>
The tears and takes the farewell of each friend, <br>
And hears one bit the other go, draw breath <br>
Freelier outside, (‘since all is o’er,’ he saith<br>
And the blow fallen no grieving can amend;’)<br>
</p>
<p class="num">VI</p>
<p class="stanza">
When some discuss if near the other graves<br>
be room enough for this, and when a day<br>
Suits best for carrying the corpse away,<br>
With care about the banners, scarves and staves<br>
And still the man hears all, and only craves<br>
He may not shame such tender love and stay.<br>
</p>

<p class="num">VII</p>
<p class="stanza">
Thus, I had so long suffered in this quest,<br>
Heard failure prophesied so oft, been writ<br>
So many times among ’The Band’ to wit,<br>
The knights who to the Dark Tower’s search addressed<br>
Their steps - that just to fail as they, seemed best,<br>
And all the doubt was now - should I be fit?<br>
</p>

<p class="num">VIII</p>
<p class="stanza">
So, quiet as despair I turned from him,<br>
That hateful cripple, out of his highway<br>
Into the path he pointed. All the day<br>
Had been a dreary one at best, and dim<br>
Was settling to its close, yet shot one grim<br>
Red leer to see the plain catch its estray.<br>
</p>

<p class="num">IX</p>
<p class="stanza">
For mark! No sooner was I fairly found<br>
Pledged to the plain, after a pace or two,<br>
Than, pausing to throw backwards a last view<br>
O’er the safe road, ’twas gone; grey plain all round;<br>
Nothing but plain to the horizon’s bound.<br>
I might go on, naught else remained to do.<br>
</p>

<p class="num">X</p>
<p class="stanza">
So on I went. I think I never saw<br>
Such starved ignoble nature; nothing throve:<br>
For flowers - as well expect a cedar grove!<br>
But cockle, spurge, according to their law<br>
Might propagate their kind with none to awe,<br>
You’d think; a burr had been a treasure trove.<br>
</p>

<p class="num">XI</p>
<p class="stanza">
No! penury, inertness and grimace,<br>
In some strange sort, were the land’s portion. ‘See<br>
Or shut your eyes,’ said Nature peevishly,<br>
It nothing skills: I cannot help my case:<br>
’Tis the Last Judgement’s fire must cure this place<br>
Calcine its clods and set my prisoners free.’<br>
</p>
<div class="thorns">

<p class="num">XII</p>
<p class="stanza">
If there pushed any ragged thistle-stalk<br>
Above its mates, the head was chopped, the bents<br>
Were jealous else. What made those holes and rents<br>
In the dock’s harsh swarth leaves, bruised as to baulk<br>
All hope of greenness? Tis a brute must walk<br>
Pashing their life out, with a brute’s intents.<br>
</p>

<p class="num">XIII</p>
<p class="stanza">
As for the grass, it grew as scant as hair<br>
In leprosy; thin dry blades pricked the mud<br>
Which underneath looked kneaded up with blood.<br>
One stiff blind horse, his every bone a-stare,<br>
Stood stupified, however he came there:<br>
Thrust out past service from the devil’s stud!<br>
</p>

<p class="num">XIV</p>
<p class="stanza">
Alive? he might be dead for aught I knew,<br>
With that red gaunt and colloped neck a-strain.<br>
And shut eyes underneath the rusty mane;<br>
Seldom went such grotesqueness with such woe;<br>
I never saw a brute I hated so;<br>
He must be wicked to deserve such pain.<br>
</p>

<p class="num">XV</p>
<p class="stanza">
I shut my eyes and turned them on my heart,<br>
As a man calls for wine before he fights,<br>
I asked one draught of earlier, happier sights,<br>
Ere fitly I could hope to play my part.<br>
Think first, fight afterwards, the soldier’s art:<br>
One taste of the old time sets all to rights.<br>
</p>

<p class="num">XVI</p>
<p class="stanza">
Not it! I fancied Cuthbert’s reddening face<br>
Beneath its garniture of curly gold,<br>
Dear fellow, till I almost felt him fold<br>
An arm to mine to fix me to the place,<br>
The way he used. Alas, one night’s disgrace!<br>
Out went my heart’s new fire and left it cold.<br>
</p>

<p class="num">XVII</p>
<p class="stanza">
Giles then, the soul of honour - there he stands<br>
Frank as ten years ago when knighted first,<br>
What honest man should dare (he said) he durst.<br>
Good - but the scene shifts - faugh! what hangman hands<br>
Pin to his breast a parchment? His own bands<br>
Read it. Poor traitor, spit upon and curst!<br>
</p>

<p class="num">XVIII</p>
<p class="stanza">
Better this present than a past like that:<br>
Back therefore to my darkening path again!<br>
No sound, no sight as far as eye could strain.<br>
Will the night send a howlet or a bat?<br>
I asked: when something on the dismal flat<br>
Came to arrest my thoughts and change their train.<br>
</p>

<p class="num">XIX</p>
<p class="stanza">
A sudden little river crossed my path<br>
As unexpected as a serpent comes.<br>
No sluggish tide congenial to the glooms;<br>
This, as it frothed by, might have been a bath<br>
For the fiend’s glowing hoof - to see the wrath<br>
Of its black eddy bespate with flakes and spumes.<br>
</p>

<p class="num">XX</p>
<p class="stanza">
So petty yet so spiteful! All along,<br>
Low scrubby alders kneeled down over it;<br>
Drenched willows flung them headlong in a fit<br>
Of mute despair, a suicidal throng:<br>
The river which had done them all the wrong,<br>
Whate’er that was, rolled by, deterred no whit.<br>
</p>

<p class="num">XXI</p>
<p class="stanza">
Which, while I forded - good saints, how I feared<br>
To set my foot upon a dead man’s cheek,<br>
Each step, of feel the spear I thrust to seek<br>
For hollows, tangled in his hair or beard!<br>
- It may have been a water-rat I speared,<br>
But, ugh! it sounded like a baby’s shriek.<br>
</p>

<p class="num">XXII</p>
<p class="stanza">
Glad was I when I reached the other bank.<br>
Now for a better country. Vain presage!<br>
Who were the strugglers, what war did they wage,<br>
Whose savage trample thus could pad the dank<br>
soil to a plash? Toads in a poisoned tank<br>
Or wild cats in a red-hot iron cage -<br>
</p>
</div>
<div class="roses">
<p class="num">XXIII</p>
<p class="stanza">
The fight must so have seemed in that fell cirque,<br>
What penned them there, with all the plain to choose?<br>
No footprint leading to that horrid mews,<br>
None out of it. Mad brewage set to work<br>
Their brains, no doubt, like galley-slaves the Turk<br>
Pits for his pastime, Christians against Jews.<br>
</p>

<p class="num">XXIV</p>
<p class="stanza">
And more than that - a furlong on - why, there!<br>
What bad use was that engine for, that wheel,<br>
Or brake, not wheel - that harrow fit to reel<br>
Men’s bodies out like silk? With all the air<br>
Of Tophet’s tool, on earth left unaware<br>
Or brought to sharpen its rusty teeth of steel.<br>
</p>

<p class="num">XXV</p>
<p class="stanza">
Then came a bit of stubbed ground, once a wood,<br>
Next a marsh it would seem, and now mere earth<br>
Desperate and done with; (so a fool finds mirth,<br>
Makes a thing and then mars it, till his mood<br>
Changes and off he goes!) within a rood -<br>
Bog, clay and rubble, sand, and stark black dearth.<br>
</p>

<p class="num">XXVI</p>
<p class="stanza">
Now blotches rankling, coloured gay and grim,<br>
Now patches where some leanness of the soil’s<br>
Broke into moss, or substances like boils;<br>
Then came some palsied oak, a cleft in him<br>
Like a distorted mouth that splits its rim<br>
Gaping at death, and dies while it recoils.<br>
</p>

<p class="num">XXVII</p>
<p class="stanza">
And just as far as ever from the end!<br>
Naught in the distance but the evening, naught<br>
To point my footstep further! At the thought,<br>
A great black bird, Apollyon’s bosom friend,<br>
Sailed past, not best his wide wing dragon-penned<br>
That brushed my cap - perchance the guide I sought.<br>
</p>

<p class="num">XXVIII</p>
<p class="stanza">
For, looking up, aware I somehow grew,<br>
’Spite of the dusk, the plain had given place<br>
All round to mountains - with such name to grace<br>
Mere ugly heights and heaps now stolen in view.<br>
How thus they had surprised me - solve it, you!<br>
How to get from them was no clearer case.<br>
</p>

<p class="num">XXIX</p>
<p class="stanza">
Yet half I seemed to recognise some trick<br>
Of mischief happened to me, God knows when -<br>
In a bad dream perhaps. Here ended, then<br>
Progress this way. When, in the very nick<br>
Of giving up, one time more, came a click<br>
As when a trap shuts - you’re inside the den.<br>
</p>

<p class="num">XXX</p>
<p class="stanza">
Burningly it came on me all at once,<br>
This was the place! those two hills on the right,<br>
Crouched like two bulls locked horn in horn in fight;<br>
While to the left a tall scalped mountain ... Dunce,<br>
Dotard, a-dozing at the very nonce,<br>
After a life spent training for the sight!<br>
</p>

<p class="num">XXXI</p>
<p class="stanza">
What in the midst lay but the Tower itself?<br>
The round squat turret, blind as the fool’s heart,<br>
Built of brown stone, without a counterpart<br>
In the whole world. The tempest’s mocking elf<br>
Points to the shipman thus the unseen shelf<br>
He strikes on, only when the timbers start.<br>
</p>

<p class="num">XXXII</p>
<p class="stanza">
Not see? because of night perhaps? - why day<br>
Came back again for that! before it left<br>
The dying sunset kindled through a cleft:<br>
The hills, like giants at a hunting, lay,<br>
Chin upon hand, to see the game at bay, -<br>
’Now stab and end the creature - to the heft!’<br>
</p>

<p class="num">XXXIII</p>
<p class="stanza">
Not hear? When noise was everywhere! it tolled<br>
Increasing like a bell. Names in my ears<br>
Of all the lost adventurers, my peers -<br>
How such a one was strong, and such was bold,<br>
And such was fortunate, yet each of old<br>
Lost, lost! one moment knelled the woe of years.<br>
</p>

<p class="num">XXXIV</p>
<p class="stanza">
There they stood, ranged along the hillsides, met<br>
To view the last of me, a living frame<br>
For one more picture! In a sheet of flame<br>
I saw them and I knew them all. And yet<br>
Dauntless the slug-horn to my lips I set,<br>
And blew. ’Childe Roland to the Dark Tower came.’<br>
