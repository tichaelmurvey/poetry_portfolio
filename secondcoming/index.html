    <p>Turning and turning in the widening gyre </p>
    <p>The falcon cannot hear the falconer;</p>
    <p>Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;</p>
    <p>Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,</p>
    <p>The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere </p>
    <p>The ceremony of innocence is drowned;</p>
    <p>The best lack all conviction, while the worst </p>
    <p class="break">Are full of passionate intensity.</p>

    <p>Surely some revelation is at hand;</p>
    <p>Surely the Second Coming is at hand. </p>
    <p>The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out </p>
    <p>When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi</p>
    <p>Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert </p>
    <p>A shape with lion body and the head of a man, </p>
    <p>A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun, </p>
    <p>Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it </p>
    <p>Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds. </p>
    <p>The darkness drops again; but now I know </p>
    <p>That twenty centuries of stony sleep</p>
    <p>Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle, </p>
    <p>And what rough beast, its hour come round at last, </p>
    <p>Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?</p>
