    <h1>O Captain! My Captain!</h1>
    <p class="author">Walt Whitman</p>
    <div class="poem-text">
      <p>O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,</p>
      <p>The ship has weather’d every rack, the prize we sought is won,</p>
      <p>The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,</p>
      <p>While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;</p>
      <p>But O heart! heart! heart!</p>
      <p>O the bleeding drops of red,</p>
      <p>Where on the deck my Captain lies,</p>
      <p>Fallen cold and dead.</p>
      <p>O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;</p>
      <p>Rise up—for you the flag is flung—for you the bugle trills,</p>
      <p>For you bouquets and ribbon’d wreaths—for you the shores a-crowding,</p>
      <p>For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;</p>
      <p>Here Captain! dear father!</p>
      <p>This arm beneath your head!</p>
      <p>It is some dream that on the deck,</p>
      <p>You’ve fallen cold and dead.</p>
      <p>My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,</p>
      <p>My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,</p>
      <p>The ship is anchor’d safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,</p>
      <p>From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;</p>
      <p>Exult O shores, and ring O bells!</p>
      <p>But I with mournful tread,</p>
      <p>Walk the deck my Captain lies,</p>
      <p>Fallen cold and dead.</p>
