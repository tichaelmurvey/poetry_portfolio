    <h1>Not so far as the forest</h1>

    <div class="poem-text">
      <div class="stanza">
        <p class="numeral">I</p>
        <p>That chill is in the air</p>
        <p>Which the wise know well, and even have learned to bear.</p>
        <p>This joy, I know,</p>
        <p>Will soon be under snow.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="stanza">
        <p>The sun sets in a cloud</p>
        <p>And is not seen.</p>
        <p>Beauty, that spoke aloud,</p>
        <p>Addresses now only the remembering ear.</p>
        <p>The heart begins here</p>
        <p>To feed on what has been.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="stanza">
        <p>Night falls fast.</p>
        <p>Today is in the past.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="stanza">
        <p>Blown from the dark hill hither to my door</p>
        <p>Three flakes, then four</p>
        <p>Arrive, then many more.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="stanza">
        <p class="numeral">II</p>
        <p>Branch by branch</p>
        <p>This tree has died. Green only</p>
        <p>Is one last bough, moving its leaves in the sun.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="stanza">
        <p>What evil ate its root, what blight,</p>
        <p>What ugly thing,</p>
        <p>Let the mole say, the bird sing;</p>
        <p>Or the white worm behind the shedding bark</p>
        <p>Tick in the dark.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="stanza">
        <p>You and I have only one thing to do:</p>
        <p>Saw the trunk through.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="stanza">
        <p class="numeral">III</p>
        <p>Distressed mind, forbear</p>
        <p>To tease the hooded Why:</p>
        <p>That shape will not reply.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="stanza">
        <p>From the warm chair</p>
        <p>To the wind's welter</p>
        <p>Flee, if storm's your shelter.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="stanza">
        <p>But no, you needs must part,</p>
        <p>Fling him his release--</p>
        <p>On whose ungenerous heart</p>
        <p>Alone you are at peace.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="stanza">
        <p class="numeral">IV</p>
        <p>Not dead of wounds, not borne</p>
        <p>Home to the village on a litter of branches, torn</p>
        <p>By splendid claws and the talk all night of the villagers,</p>
        <p>But stung to death by gnats</p>
        <p>Lies Love.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="stanza">
        <p>What swamp I sweated through for all these years</p>
        <p>Is at length plain to me.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="stanza">
        <p>V</p>
        <p>Poor passionate thing,</p>
        <p>Even with this clipped wing how well you flew!--though not so far as the forest.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="stanza">
        <p>Unwounded and unspent, serene but for the eye's bright trouble,
        <p>Was it the lurching flight, the unequal wind under the lopped feathers that brought you down,</p>
        <p>To sit in folded colours on the empty level field,</p>
        <p>Visible as a ship, paling the yellow stubble?</p>
      </div>
      <div class="stanza">
        <p>Rebellious bird, warm body foreign and bright,</p>
        <p>Has no one told you?--Hopeless is your flight</p>
        <p>Towards the high branches. Here is your home,</p>
        <p>Between barnyard strewn with grain and the forest tree.</p>
        <p>Though Time refeather the wing,</p>
        <p>Ankle slip the ring,</p>
        <p>The once-confined thing</p>
        <p>Is never again free.</p>
