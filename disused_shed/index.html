    <div class="stanza">
        <p>Even now there are places where a thought might grow —</p>
        <p>Peruvian mines, worked out and abandoned</p>
        <p>To a slow clock of condensation,</p>
        <p>An echo trapped for ever, and a flutter</p>
        <p>Of wildflowers in the lift-shaft,</p>
        <p>Indian compounds where the wind dances</p>
        <p>And a door bangs with diminished confidence,</p>
        <p>Lime crevices behind rippling rain barrels,</p>
        <p>Dog corners for bone burials;</p>
        <p>And in a disused shed in Co. Wexford,</p>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
        <p>Deep in the grounds of a burnt-out hotel,</p>
        <p>Among the bathtubs and the washbasins</p>
        <p>A thousand mushrooms crowd to a keyhole.</p>
        <p>This is the one star in their firmament</p>
        <p>Or frames a star within a star.</p>
        <p>What should they do there but desire?</p>
        <p>So many days beyond the rhododendrons</p>
        <p>With the world waltzing in its bowl of cloud,</p>
        <p>They have learnt patience and silence</p>
        <p>Listening to the rooks querulous in the high wood.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
        <p>They have been waiting for us in a foetor</p>
        <p>Of vegetable sweat since civil war days,</p>
        <p>Since the gravel-crunching, interminable departure</p>
        <p>Of the expropriated mycologist.</p>
        <p>He never came back, and light since then</p>
        <p>Is a keyhole rusting gently after rain.</p>
        <p>Spiders have spun, flies dusted to mildew</p>
        <p>And once a day, perhaps, they have heard something —</p>
        <p>A trickle of masonry, a shout from the blue</p>
        <p>Or a lorry changing gear at the end of the lane.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
        <p>There have been deaths, the pale flesh flaking</p>
        <p>Into the earth that nourished it;</p>
        <p>And nightmares, born of these and the grim</p>
        <p>Dominion of stale air and rank moisture.</p>
        <p>Those nearest the door grow strong —</p>
        <p>‘Elbow room! Elbow room!’</p>
        <p>The rest, dim in a twilight of crumbling</p>
        <p>Utensils and broken pitchers, groaning</p>
        <p>For their deliverance, have been so long</p>
        <p>Expectant that there is left only the posture.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
        <p>A half century, without visitors, in the dark —</p>
        <p>Poor preparation for the cracking lock</p>
        <p>And creak of hinges; magi, moonmen,</p>
        <p>Powdery prisoners of the old regime,</p>
        <p>Web-throated, stalked like triffids, racked by drought</p>
        <p>And insomnia, only the ghost of a scream</p>
        <p>At the flash-bulb firing-squad we wake them with</p>
        <p>Shows there is life yet in their feverish forms.</p>
        <p>Grown beyond nature now, soft food for worms,</p>
        <p>They lift frail heads in gravity and good faith.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="stanza">
        <p>They are begging us, you see, in their wordless way,</p>
        <p>To do something, to speak on their behalf</p>
        <p>Or at least not to close the door again.</p>
        <p>Lost people of Treblinka and Pompeii!</p>
        <p>‘Save us, save us,’ they seem to say,</p>
        <p>‘Let the god not abandon us</p>
        <p>Who have come so far in darkness and in pain.</p>
        <p>We too had our lives to live.</p>
        <p>You with your light meter and relaxed itinerary,</p>
        <p>Let not our naive labours have been in vain!’</p>
